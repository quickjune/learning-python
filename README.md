# learning-python


This repository is used for my learning in python from Jose portilla.
Also please find the complete python bootcamp of jose portilla

i have implemented that on jupyter notebook. so please look upon the jupyter source file.

rather than pushing a new file everytime.i have pulled and updated the file and pushed again in the same jupyter source file

Thus there is only one jupyter source file.
